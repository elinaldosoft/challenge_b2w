## Conding Challenge Hell Triangle

The apllication have three methods, are they:

- get_values and prepare_matrix - I received on matrix. Example: [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
The `get_values` use the method `prepare_matrix` for
organization the matrix, case the positions of arrays, they are in disorder.
After of ordering the array, the extract is realization of values selected in triangle.

- summed - Received on list and return a summed. Example: [1, 2, 3, 4]
